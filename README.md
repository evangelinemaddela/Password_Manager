# Password Manager
This code creates a simple password manager using cryptography and file handling in Python

## Description
The code starts by loading the encryption key using load_key().
It then enters an infinite loop that keeps prompting the user for a mode ("view", "add", or "q").
If the user enters "q", the loop breaks and the program exits.
If the user enters "view", the view() function is called to display existing passwords.
If the user enters "add", the add() function is called to allow them to add a new password.
Any other input is considered invalid, and the user is prompted to try again.

## Languages and Frameworks used:
We require Python & 'Cryptography' python package to run this, this package is built-in to python, just import and use it.
